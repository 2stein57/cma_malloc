This is a simple kernel module and a library to allocate continuous memory from the Linux kernel.
Make sure your kernel is compiled with CMA and DMA enabled. To use this module, the CMA memory needs to be in the address space addressable with 32 bits.
On AMD64 systems, this might not be done per default. Use the following kernel parameter to fix this:

cma=256M@0G-4G

256 means 256 MiB can can, offcourse, be changed to something else.
